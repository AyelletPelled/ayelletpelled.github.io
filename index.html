            I am a doctoral candidate at UW-Madison, currently working on my dissertaion.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research interests reside within the Bermuda triangle of social psychology, media effects and emotions,
            with a focus on social	cognition and	the	underlying	psychological mechanisms of information processing. 
        </P>
        <p>
            More specifically, I am interested in perception biases that lead people to interpret the same information differently, 
            and how those cognitive process influence behavior, personal judgment and decision-making. 
        </P>
        <p>
            I examine these cognitive processes under varied contexts and theoretical frameworks such as psychology of emotions, 
            group identity, selective exposure, visual & nonverbal communication, impression formation and attitude change.

        </P>
        <p>
            I obtained an M.A. degree in Communication Research and a double B.A major in Communication & Fine Arts from the University of Haifa, Israel. 
            
            I also received a diploma in "Graphic Design for Web & Marketing" from the John Bryce College in Tel-Aviv, Israel 
            and I have been working as a graphic designer since 2008.
